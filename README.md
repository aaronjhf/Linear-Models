This repo is dedicated to recaputilating various results relevant to machine learning in idealized settings, such as linear models, or tasks on classic data sets, like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
I also follow "A Solveable Model of Neural Scaling Laws" by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully, which analyzes scaling in the case of random feature models. I intersperse additional explorations throughout.
