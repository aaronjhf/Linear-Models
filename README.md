This repo is dedicated to recaputilating various results relevant to machine learning in idealized settings. I study linear models as well as neural networks trained on classic computer vision datasets, e.g. CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
I also follow "A Solveable Model of Neural Scaling Laws" by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully, which analyzes scaling in the case of random feature models. 

I also look at aspects of linearization such as the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). In particular I investigate the factorization of the NTK when a model has multi-dimensional outputs e.g. classification tasks like in MNIST.
