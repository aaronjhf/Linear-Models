This repo is dedicated to recaputilating various results relevant to machine learning in idealized settings, such as linear models, or on now canonical and thoroughly studied datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
We also follow "A Solveable Model of Neural Scaling Laws" by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully, which analyzes scaling in the case of random feature models. We intersperse additional explorations throughout.
