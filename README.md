This repo is dedicated to recaputilating various results relevant to machine learning in idealized settings. We study linear models as well as neural networks trained on classic computer vision datasets, e.g. CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
I also follow "A Solveable Model of Neural Scaling Laws" by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully, which analyzes scaling in the case of random feature models. I intersperse additional explorations throughout, such as the NTK of an MLP on MNIST, demonstrating that it non-trivially factorizes in the different prediction channels.
