This repo is dedicated broadly to recaputilating various results relevant to machine learning in idealized settings, such as linear models, or now canonical and thoroughly studied datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
Some of the contents of these scripts and notebooks follow papers, such as "A Solveable Model of Neural Scaling Laws" by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully, adding some additional explorations interspersed throughout.
